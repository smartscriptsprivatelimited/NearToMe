# NearToMe

**Case Study:** **NearToMe** – A Smooth Business Website with eCommerce Integration

**Client:** Internal project – NearToMe

**Website:** [NearToMe](https://neartome.net)

**Technology Stack:** PHP, MySQL, WordPress, Elementor, Astra Theme, WooCommerce, Google ReCAPTCHA

**Overview**
NearToMe is our internal project where we want to bring local services together with end-users in an intelligent, simple manner. We had a vision for a website that would not only present our services but also facilitate smooth transactions through a hassle-free online shopping storefront.

**Technology Stack**
- **Frontend & Backend:** WordPress using Astra Theme and Elementor (Eliminator)
- **eCommerce:** WooCommerce
- **Backend Database:** MySQL
- **Language:** PHP
- **Security & Bot Protection:** Google ReCAPTCHA

**Objective**
Create a quick, responsive, and accessible business website for NearToMe that:
- Is professionally presenting our brand and services
- Supports online purchasing of products
- Is simple to maintain internally without significant technical expertise

**Challenges**
1. **Design Consistency & UI/UX:**
	Given that we're a business-oriented platform, design took priority. We were challenged to craft a clean, modern design that's both conversion-driven and accessible, particularly given Elementor's flexible but at times bloated nature.

2. **WooCommerce Customization:**
	Integrating WooCommerce into our selected theme (Astra) and making it look integrated with the overall layout took additional tweaking. 

3. **Speed & Performance:**
	High-quality visuals and performance were balanced by being careful with heavy plugins like WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce. We tuned caching, minimized unnecessary scripts, and optimized assets. 

4. **Security:**
	Being an eCommerce solution, security of user data was a requirement. Google ReCAPTCHA was implemented in every contact and checkout form to reduce spamming and bot traffic.

**Solutions & Key Features**
- Elementor Templates on custom terms for product pages and landing segments, maintaining the brand identity
- WooCommerce Integration for easy product administration and payment settlement
- Astra Theme offered a lightweight foundation with ample flexibility
- Responsive Design for maximum experience across devices
- Google ReCAPTCHA v3 for invisible, user-friendly bot protection
- SEO Optimizations such as schema, meta tags, and fast-loading images

**Results**

✅ Business website with online payments fully functional
✅ 100% mobile-responsive and optimized for all screen sizes
✅ Admins can now easily manage content and products
